A lot has happened over summer.
<br/>
We have had great news about two of our big European project bids:
1. ESIWACE2 has been funded and will begin in January 2019, and overlap with the end of ESIWACE itself.
2. IS-ENES3 has also been funded, and will also begin in January 2019.

We will have much more to say about those in the future.

In other news, [Bryan](/bio/bryan) has a [new paper](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/11/3659/2018/) out on the requirements needed for the CMIP6 global data infrastructure,
and also delivered two significant talks in the last couple of weeks.
1. At the Hydro-Jules open meeting, on [plans to build the Hydro-Jules modelling framework](http://www.bnlawrence.net/talks/2018/09/lawrence-hydrojules/), and
2. At an Extreme Data workshop in Julich, on methods of [beating data bottlenecks in weather and climate science](http://www.bnlawrence.net/talks/2018/09/lawrence-extreme-data/).
