### Biography ###
I did my PhD in Quantum Field theory at Edinburgh University between 1995 and 1998. I used a Cray T3D (and later T3E) to calculate the spectra and decays of heavy mesons.  between 1999 and 2005 I continued this research first as a PPARC personal fellow then as a common or garden PDRA. By this time I reasised it was perhaps the mathematics and computation that I wished to persue and I joined the Edinburgh parallel computing centre (EPCC) <epcc.ed.ac.uk>. Here I ported, optimised and developed scientific and commercial code for High Performance Computers (HPC), engaged into research for methods exploiting such machines and taught aspects of HPC to students on the MSc course.  In 2012 I left EPCC and joined the Met Office as a scientific software engineer <www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/christopher-maynard>. Where I applied what I had learnt to developing the Unified Model and later as a member of the team writing LFRic, a new atmospheric model. I now work part-time for the Met Office.
