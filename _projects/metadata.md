## Metadata Taxonomy

Lawrence et al 2009 ([doi:10.1098/rsta.2008.0237](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2008.0237))
introduced a metadata taxonomy which classifed relevant metadata into Archive, Browse,
Character, Discovery and Extra.

The ACES group has been carrying out work on A metadata for managing data at scale (such
as the [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org)), and B metadata related to
documenting climate models ([ES-DOC](https://es-doc.org)) and managing heterogeneous
data (such as MOLES - Parton et al, 2015, [doi:10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.365](https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.365)).
