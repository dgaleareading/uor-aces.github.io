[Chris](bio/chris.html), along with colleagues from the Met Office,
visted [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov). The
machine room tour was great to see and stand next to Titan (Ex #1 on
[top 500 list](http://www.top500.org), current ranking is #5), and their new machine, Summit, still be commissioned. Humungous!
