### Research Interests

* Parallel file systems
* Performance portability
* Data reduction techniques
* Management of cluster systems
* Performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O
* Software engineering of scientific software

### Biography

My doctorate (2013) was on the monitoring and simulation of parallel programs on the application and system level. Since then I have had a post-doctoral position at DKRZ where I worked on a range of projects, as well as teaching at the University of Hamburg Informatics Department where I was also a member of the scientific computing group. I am a member of various program committees and my community support activity has included organising I/O workshops and setting up several years of birds-of-a-feather sessions over recent years at SC and ISC.  I was a member of the steering committee in the former Exascale10 activity, and in 2015, with a number of international colleagues founded the Virtual Institute of I/O ([VI4IO](https://www.vi4io.org)) which provides a "storage equivalent" of the HPC Top500 utilising the IO-500 benchmarks. Currently, I am focusing on optimization of parallel I/O and on novel I/O interfaces for Exascale.

### Teaching

I will begin teaching at the University of Reading in the 2018/19 academic year.
